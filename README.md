These are my first steps in Android. This app saves bookmarks to the bookmarks app on your owncloud instance. Feedback, (comments, suggestions, insults) welcome!

### Tested with
- Android 4.1.1 and Owncloud 6.0.3

### Praise
- HTTP communications made possible with [ion](https://github.com/koush/ion)
- Icons taken from [the Oxygen Team](https://github.com/pasnox/oxygen-icons-png)
- Server side is (of course) the [Owncloud bookmark app](https://github.com/owncloud/bookmarks)
