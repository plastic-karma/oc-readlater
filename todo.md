TODO
====
- Display existing bookmarks
  - open bookmarks
  - delete bookmarks
  - edit bookmarks
- Abstract communication to owncloud bookmark app, because maybe a real api will emerge at some point
- Make notifications optional
  - make notification slider
- Different symbol for 'upload successful' notification
- Unittesting (seems like black magic in android)
